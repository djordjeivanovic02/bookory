                    Janice Hallett is a British author, screenwriter and an
                    award-winning journalist, best known for her phenomenally
                    successful debut thriller The Appeal. Before her breakout
                    entry into the realms of crime fiction, Janice Hallett
                    worked as a journalist, magazine editor and speech writer
                    for the Cabinet Office and Home Office, as well as writing
                    for the stage and screen. Her first feature film Retreat
                    (co-written and directed by Carl Tibbetts) came out in 2011,
                    and she won the award for Best New Screenplay at the 2014
                    British Independent Film Festival.
