                I am 6 feet tall and 220 lbs. This shirt fit me perfectly in the
                chest and shoulders. My only complaint is that it is so long! I
                like to wear polo shirts untucked. This shirt goes completely
                past my rear end. If I wore it with ordinary shorts, you
                probably wouldnt be able to see the shorts at all â€“ completely
                hidden by the shirt. It needs to be 4 to 5 inches shorter in
                terms of length to suit me. I have many RL polo shirts, and this
                one is by far the longest. I dont understand why.
